I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student working with Professor [Tina Eliassi-Rad](http://eliassi.org/) at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/), [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), Boston. I am interested in graph machine learning, specifically link prediction, graph embeddings, applying network science in graph machine learning, and biological networks. I got my Bachelor of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), India, and hold a Master's degree in Electronic Systems Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/). Prior to joining NetSI, I was working at [NVIDIA Graphics](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), developing and optimizing GPU architectures for AI and video processing applications.
